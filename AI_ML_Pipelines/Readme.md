# AI/ML Pipelines: Churn Prediction

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates experience with AI/ML systems, handling structured and unstructured data, and deploying predictive models. This project shows the end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness. It also documents Agile execution and metrics to showcase program management skills.

## Project Details

- **Dataset:** `churn_data.csv` – sample customer data with demographics, subscription info, activity, and churn status.  
- **Pipeline Steps:**  
  1. Load dataset  
  2. Preprocess data (categorical encoding, feature scaling)  
  3. Split data into train/test sets  
  4. Train machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier)  
  5. Evaluate model performance (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix)  
  6. Save model for deployment (optional)  

- **Tools & Technologies:**  
  - Python (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib)  
  - BigQuery / GCP (can simulate locally)  
  - Agile project execution

## Metrics / Results

- **Accuracy:** 89%  
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.92  
- Confusion matrix and model predictions available in the notebook
